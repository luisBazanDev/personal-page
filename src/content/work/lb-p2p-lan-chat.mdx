I developed this project because, before an exam, while we were chatting, someone jokingly suggested we talk on WhatsApp (which was funny because the teacher blocks internet access). That sparked the idea of creating a chat that works without internet, only on a local network, and without a central server-because if the server became unavailable for any reason, the chat would be useless. So the concept of building a peer‑to‑peer chat with a mesh architecture came up, ensuring that messages would keep flowing without a single point of failure.

### **Key Contributions**

- **Peers Network:** Designing a [peer‑to‑peer architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) with no single point of failure teaches resilience, scalability, and fault tolerance—fundamental principles for modern systems.
