**Bifrost Network** was a Minecraft server project funded by [Max Gatiks](https://twitch.tv/max_gatiks), a small streamer from Chile. I took on the roles of **Lead Developer** and **Project Manager**, overseeing the entire technical and organizational side of the project.

Together with the building team, we created a network-based server designed to handle high user loads. The server featured popular and custom game modes, including **SkyWars**, **BedWars**, and **Custom Survival**.

### Key Contributions

- **Discord Bots Development:** Built bots with seamless integration into the Minecraft server for real-time interactions.
- **Global Economy System:** Designed and implemented a cross-server economy system using [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-bungeecord/) and [Spigot APIs](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/about-spigot/).
- **Web Development & Store:** Developed the official website and configured an online store powered by **[Tebex](https://www.tebex.io/)**.
- **Network Architecture:** Managed a multi-server setup with 5 interconnected servers supporting up to **200 concurrent players**.

This project showcased my ability to combine backend development, server management, and cross-platform integrations to create a complete gaming experience.
