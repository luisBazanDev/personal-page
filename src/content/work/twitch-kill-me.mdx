**TwitchKillMe** is a Minecraft plugin I developed in my free time to bring a new level of interactivity between Twitch streamers and their audience. The idea came from wanting to give viewers the ability to directly influence the gameplay in real-time, creating a more engaging and entertaining streaming experience.

I built a full integration with the Twitch API, supporting channel points, bits, subscriptions, hype trains, and real-time chat events. The plugin features a **modular reward system**, allowing streamers to configure a wide range of in-game actions such as summoning mobs, giving items, placing blocks, freezing players, or even teleporting them all triggered by Twitch interactions.

To make the setup seamless, I implemented automatic [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) token management, a **fully customizable YAML configuration system**, and detailed documentation to guide users step by step. The plugin also supports multiple languages (English and Spanish) and is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/luisBazanDev/TwitchKillMe/blob/main/LICENSE) on Spigot, allowing the community to freely use and contribute.

## Key Skills I Developed

Working on TwitchKillMe allowed me to strengthen and expand my technical skill set, including:

- **API integration** (Twitch API & REST protocols)
- **Plugin development for Minecraft (Spigot/Paper)**
- **Event-driven architecture and modular system design**
- **Authentication and security** (OAuth2 token management)
- **Configuration management with YAML**
- **Technical writing and documentation**
- **Multi-language support and localization**
- **Problem-solving and performance optimization**

This project reflects my passion for combining game development with streaming technology, resulting in a tool that enhances both the gameplay experience and audience engagement.
