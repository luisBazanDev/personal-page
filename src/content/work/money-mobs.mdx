I originally developed the plugin as part of [Bifrost Network](/work/bifrost-network), as an economy mechanic within the server. It was built to integrate with [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault), a widely used Minecraft plugin that provides an economy API used by thousands of other plugins. Later on, I decided to make the code public because I felt it could be useful to more peopleâ€”and it clearly is. It now has a few thousand downloads and some community contributions to the source code.

The project is currently archived, but it still works with the latest game updates thanks to its simplicity.
