Even before the pandemic, I was already involved in online communities, mostly around video games and programming. At first, I was just a participant, joining events and leaving constructive feedback. But over time, I got more involved behind the scenes, helping organize events and supporting the community as part of the staff. Looking back, that experience helped me grow a lot, both professionally and personally. I also met some amazing people through those spaces, many of whom I now call friends.

Later on, together with two friends, we decided to create [Many To One Community](https://mtocommunity.com/) because there wasn’t anything like it at our university. From the beginning, the mission was clear: "This is built by students, for students." While the university supported us by providing spaces for events, meetups, and workshops, we still had to push hard to make things happen, there were no real precedents for this kind of initiative on campus.

I can’t say for sure whether the community will continue once I finish my time at the university, but I know that, for now, we’ve already been able to help a lot of students. We've opened doors, built connections, and made an academic impact. so much so that the university took notice of how we were helping students stand out and build a stronger sense of community, at least within our field of study.

## Skills I’ve gained from this experience:

- **Leadership**: I’ve learned to coordinate teams, make key decisions, and motivate others to get involved.

- **Event organization**: I’ve planned and executed in-person events—from workshops and seminars to community meetings—handling everything from logistics to promotion.

- **Networking**: I’ve built meaningful relationships with fellow students, professors, and professionals, which has enriched both my learning and my future opportunities.
