I created this project because, at the time, I couldn’t find any API that did the same thing and was up to date with the latest versions of the game. I designed the plugin as a way to centralize “kits”, which are basically sets of items with either fixed or dynamic slots.

The idea of centralizing kits helps avoid repetitive and redundant storage, while also offering a way to share kits between different plugins using a clear and unified language. For example, in minigame or lobby plugins, you can have different kits or inventories where items are assigned to players.
