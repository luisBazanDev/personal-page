      <p class="">
        I believe that knowledge grows when shared. That’s why I lead and
        support student communities focused on tech, creativity, and
        collaboration.
        <br />
        <br />
        From organizing workshops and study sessions to building tools that empower
        others, I help people learn, build, and connect — together.

        content="I've seen Luis set the bar for everyone else. She built and nurtured the community, managed a team, organized and ran conferences in record time, created quality screencasts, gave talks, wrote articles, held meetups, and put us on the map. I often wondered if we had the same 24 hours in a day."
